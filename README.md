#Pair Programming Git Console
Runner-up at the first appAcademy Hackathon February 2016, Pair Programming Git Console (PPGC)
is a console wrapper that allows, as the name suggests, more efficient pair programming and git
management.

### Usage
As this product is in development, the implementation is clunky at the moment and forces you to
move all of the files of this repo into your project folder and then `ruby run.rb` from the
command line. For a good demo, you can just do this command inside the cloned folder.

Ideally, PPGC will become a command line gem, much like bundler, and you will just call
`ppg start` from the command line in the directory of your pair programming project.
